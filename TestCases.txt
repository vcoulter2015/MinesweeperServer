For each handler:
-- No post data given.
http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss -v

-- String that isn't JSON.
echo 'John' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss

-- JSON string that isn't a map (key-value pair(s)).
echo '"text": { "data": "Click Here",  "size": 36, "style": "bold" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss
echo '[1, 2, 3]' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss

-- JSON string that's a map that doesn't contain "name".
echo '{ "style": "bold" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss

-- JSON string that's a map that contains "name", but "name" is blank.
echo '{ "name": "" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss

For WinHandler:
-- JSON string doesn't contain the key "score".
echo '{ "name": "Bob", "whynot" : "just cuz" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/win

-- JSON string contains "score" but it's not an integer.
echo '{ "name": "Bob", "score" : "10a" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/win

-- JSON string contains "score" but it's a rational number & not an integer.
echo '{ "name": "Bob", "score" : "10.0" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/win

For each handler:

-- (with valid JSON name/value pair): new player name
(N.B. server assumes client will case data correctly, but if a player puts in "John D" one time
and "John D." another, I think they'll have 2 different records. However, "john D." and "John D."
should have one record IF they go thru client processing.)

-- (with valid JSON name/value pair): existing player name

On the client:

Reveal, if pressed when there is already a win/lose/draw message, doesn't record a draw.
Likewise for Restart.

Usernames to try:
Assume that the player'd never type in a name longer than 35.
Assume that the playerd never type
| and some people type very 'silly'   stuff
And some people type very silly
'^^@@"
 | | | | |
  1                              /\/\/\/\
 would a player ever type in a ** long name

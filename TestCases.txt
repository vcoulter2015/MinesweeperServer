For each handler:

http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss -v

echo '{ "style": "bold" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss

-- JSON string that's a map that contains "name", but "name" is blank.
echo '{ "name": "" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/loss

For WinHandler:
-- JSON string doesn't contain the key "score".
echo '{ "name": "Bob", "whynot" : "just cuz" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/win

-- JSON string contains "score" but it's not an integer.
echo '{ "name": "Bob", "score" : "10a" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/win

echo '{ "name": "Bob", "score" : "10.0" }' | http post :5700/:eyedocmd/Minesweeper/win

For each handler:

-- (with valid JSON name/value pair): new player name
(N.B. server assumes client will case data correctly, but if a player puts in "John D" one time
and "John D." another, I think they'll have 2 different records. However, "john D." and "John D."
should have one record IF they go thru client processing.)

-- (with valid JSON name/value pair): existing player name
